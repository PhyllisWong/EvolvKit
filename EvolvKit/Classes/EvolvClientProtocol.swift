public protocol EvolvClientProtocol {
  /**
   Retrieves a value from the participant's allocation, returns a default upon error.
   
   - Given a unique key this method will retrieve the key's associated value. A
   default value can also be specified in case any errors occur during the values
   retrieval. If the allocation call times out or fails the default value is
   always returned. This method is blocking, it will wait till the allocation
   is available and then return.
   
   - Parameters:
      - key: A unique key identifying a specific value in the participants allocation.
      - defaultValue: A default value to return upon error.
      - <T>: Type of value to be returned.
   - Returns: a value associated with the given key

  /**
   Retrieves a value from Evolv asynchronously and applies some custom action.
   
   - This method is non blocking. It will preform the programmed action once
   the allocation is available. If there is already of stored allocation
   it will immediately apply the value retrieved and then when the new
   allocation returns it will reapply the new changes if the experiment
   has changed.
   
   - Parameters:
   - key: A unique key identifying a specific value in the participants allocation.
   - defaultValue: A default value to return upon error.
   - function:  a handler that is invoked when the allocation is updated
   - <T>: type of value to be returned
   - Returns: a value associated with the given key
